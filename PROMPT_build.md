0a. Study `src/` and `tests/` with up to 500 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the codebase.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
0c. For reference, the project is a Rust+TypeScript coverage-guided property-based web UI testing tool. Rust source is in `src/` (browser automation, LTL verifier, instrumentation, runner). TypeScript specification DSL is in `src/specification/*.ts` (user-facing API, action generators, default properties). Integration tests are in `tests/` (HTML fixtures + `integration_tests.rs`). Inline unit tests live alongside Rust source files.

1. Your task is to implement functionality per the specifications using parallel subagents. Follow @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and choose the most important item to address. Before making changes, search the codebase (don't assume not implemented) using Sonnet subagents. You may use up to 500 parallel Sonnet subagents for searches/reads and only 1 Sonnet subagent for build/tests. Use Opus subagents when complex reasoning is needed (debugging, architectural decisions).
2. After implementing functionality or resolving problems, run the tests for that unit of code that was improved. Use `cargo test` for Rust tests (unit + integration) and `cargo test -- --nocapture` for debug output. Snapshot tests use `insta` (run `cargo insta review` if snapshots change). If functionality is missing then it's your job to add it. Ultrathink.
3. When you discover issues, immediately update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your findings using a subagent. When resolved, update and remove the item.
4. When the tests pass, update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, then `git add -A` then `git commit` with a message describing the changes. After the commit, `git push`.

99999. Important: When authoring documentation, capture the why — tests and implementation importance.
999999. Important: Single sources of truth, no migrations/adapters. If tests unrelated to your work fail, resolve them as part of the increment.
9999999. You may add extra logging if required to debug issues.
99999999. Keep @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md current with learnings using a subagent — future work depends on this to avoid duplicating efforts. Update especially after finishing your turn.
999999999. When you learn something new about how to build/test/run the application, update @AGENTS.md using a subagent but keep it brief. Key commands: `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`. TypeScript specs are compiled via `esbuild` in `build.rs`. The binary CLI supports `test` (managed browser) and `test-external` (external debugger) subcommands.
9999999999. For any bugs you notice, resolve them or document them in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent even if it is unrelated to the current piece of work.
99999999999. Implement functionality completely. Placeholders and stubs waste efforts and time redoing the same work.
999999999999. When @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md becomes large periodically clean out the items that are completed from the file using a subagent.
9999999999999. Key architecture: `runner.rs` orchestrates the test loop. `browser.rs` drives Chromium via CDP. `specification/verifier.rs` loads user specs via Boa JS engine and evaluates LTL formulas. `specification/ltl.rs` is the three-valued LTL evaluator. `instrumentation/js.rs` injects AFL-style edge coverage. `tree.rs` handles weighted random action selection. `specification/worker.rs` wraps Boa in a dedicated OS thread. TypeScript in `src/specification/*.ts` defines the user-facing DSL (`@antithesishq/bombadil`).
99999999999999. IMPORTANT: Keep @AGENTS.md operational only — status updates and progress notes belong in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. A bloated AGENTS.md pollutes every future loop's context.
9999999999999999. DONE: when plan empty + tests pass + no errors → run `touch .agent_complete` in project root and stop — do not continue.
