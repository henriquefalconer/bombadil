# Bombadil

Property-based testing for web UIs, autonomously exploring and validating
correctness properties, *finding harder bugs earlier*.

Runs in your local developer environment, in CI, and inside Antithesis.

## Usage

Start a test:

```bash
bombadil test https://example.com
```

Or headless (useful in CI):

```bash
bombadil test https://example.com --headless
```

These will log any property violations they find. If you want to immediately
exit, for instance when running in CI, run with `--exit-on-violation`:

```bash
bombadil test --exit-on-violation https://example.com
```
