# Bombadil

Property-based testing for web UIs, autonomously exploring and validating
correctness properties, *finding harder bugs earlier*.

Runs in your local developer environment, in CI, and inside Antithesis.

> [!NOTE]
> Bombadil is new and experimental. Stuff is going to change in the early days. Even so, we hope you'll try it out!
