0a. Study `src/` and `tests/` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the codebase structure and existing implementations.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study shared modules with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents: `src/specification/*.ts` (TypeScript DSL), `src/specification/*.rs` (Rust verifier/LTL), `src/browser/*.rs` (browser automation), `src/instrumentation/*.rs` (coverage instrumentation), `src/trace/*.rs` (trace output).
0d. For reference, the project is a Rust+TypeScript coverage-guided property-based web UI testing tool. Rust source is in `src/` (core engine). TypeScript specification DSL is in `src/specification/*.ts` (user-facing `@antithesishq/bombadil` API). Integration tests are in `tests/` (HTML fixtures + `integration_tests.rs`). Inline unit tests and `insta` snapshot tests live alongside Rust source files.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents to study existing source code in `src/` (Rust + TypeScript) and `tests/` and compare against project goals. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, `#[allow(unused)]` markers, and inconsistent patterns. Key areas to audit: LTL evaluator (`specification/ltl.rs`), browser state machine (`browser.rs`), instrumentation coverage (`instrumentation/js.rs`), action generation (`specification/defaults/actions.ts`), verifier (`specification/verifier.rs`), runner loop (`runner.rs`). Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `src/specification/*.ts` as the user-facing DSL and `src/specification/*.rs` as the Rust-side specification engine. Prefer idiomatic Rust patterns and existing module boundaries over ad-hoc additions. You can commit your changes. Don't let @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md get too big with too many unnecessary historical tracking details. Clean up the implementation plan to focus on what's relevant going forward, removing some historical tracking details.

ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve [project-specific goal]. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.
