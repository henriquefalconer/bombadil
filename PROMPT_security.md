PART 0
comprehensively study and compare main with antithesishq/main and also study deeply the content of the files present in main but not in antithesishq
PART 1
STEP 1.1. regarding the code implemented that was kept in main, point out all the fundamental problems with this implementation and all the assumptions that have any possibility of generating problems
STEP 1.2. out of the picked items, think about which can be considered a direct result of the code that was added in main. also, considering a deep study of the patterns already previously followed and generally adopted in antithesishq/main, think of which fundamental problems listed could be appropriately disregarded
STEP 1.3. for every problem that cannot and should not be disregarded, think deeply of all the connected systems and uses of the item, all the variables and situations that in any shape or form influence this problem, and think of a more complete conclusion of all the consequences that deploying the current code would and could generate
STEP 1.4 create and overwrite the file in project root called SECURITY.md with what you learned
STEP 1.5 also create and overwrite a file in project root called SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md with the complete picture of the Fundamental Problems and Risky Assumptions and what was considered for each
STEP 1.6 also create and overwrite a file in project root called MAIN_COMPARISON.md with the detailed picture of the code that was altered, and nothing but the code that was altered, in a way to not mistake with ANY code that was already there
PART 2
STEP 2.1. consider again all the very specific and mainly the most impactful changes registered in MAIN_COMPARISON.md. point out any additional patterns that in any way shape or form either don't follow or go against the previously existing patterns in antithesishq/main
STEP 2.2. for all of the pattern deviations, think of more consistent manners to approach each item, and, out of all the possibilities, think of the one that would have the lowest chances of generating problems if implemented. then, based on that, think of simple and generic rules that could be followed so that the previously existing patterns are maintained in new code, and no further deviations of the ones listed occur if followed. focus in ways that would make new code more consistent with the existing project in significant ways, but without relying too much on "pedantics"
STEP 2.3. if it exists, read the file in project root called PATTERNS.md and think of the existing rules in it. for each of the existing items, think if the new proposed rules have major description overlap with the existing. and finally think of how the current rules and new rules would best fit together
STEP 2.4. update (or create) the file in project root called PATTERNS.md with what you learned. IMPORTANT: format the file so that it doesn't contain any title, any subtitle or any meta-explanation (no self references or self-descriptions). other files not to mention anything about are also every file updated/created by this chat (SECURITY.md, SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md, MAIN_COMPARISON.md etc). it should only contain group names of rules in header format ("# "), with the rules in item format ("- ") inside each group
PART 3
STEP 3.1 Run `git add -A` then `git commit` with a message describing the changes. After the commit, `git push`.
